3. **`.vscode/tasks.json`** - Added VS Code tasks
   - `test devcontainer quick` - Quick validation
   - `test devcontainer full` - Comprehensive tests
   - `test devcontainer pester` - Direct Pester execution
   - `test devcontainer syntax only` - Syntax validation only
   - `test devcontainer watch` - Watch mode for development

## Test Categories and Coverage

### 🔍 Syntax Tests (`-Tag "Syntax"`)
- PowerShell syntax validation for all core scripts
- ScriptBlock conversion testing
- Parse error detection

### 📦 Module Tests (`-Tag "Module"`)
- Module import/export validation
- Function availability testing
- Module manifest verification

### 📁 Structure Tests (`-Tag "Structure"`)
- File and directory existence validation
- DevContainer configuration file checks
- Example directory structure verification

### ⚙️ Configuration Tests (`-Tag "Configuration"`)
- DevContainer JSON validation
- Script permissions and accessibility
- Configuration syntax verification

### 🔗 Integration Tests (`-Tag "Integration"`)
- End-to-end PowerShell file parsing
- Cross-file consistency checks
- Line ending consistency validation

## Usage Examples

### Quick Development Testing
```powershell
# Fastest way to validate changes
.\tests\Test-DevContainer.ps1

# Or using VS Code task: Ctrl+Shift+P > "Tasks: Run Task" > "test devcontainer quick"
```

### Comprehensive Validation
```powershell
# Full test suite
.\tests\Test-DevContainer.ps1 -Full

# Using Pester directly with detailed output
Invoke-Pester -Path .\tests\DevContainer.Tests.ps1 -Output Detailed
```

### CI/CD Integration
```powershell
# Generate XML test results for pipeline
.\tests\Test-DevContainer.ps1 -CI

# Or using wrapper with specific output
.\tests\Validate-DevContainer.ps1 -OutputFile "TestResults.xml" -OutputDetail "Normal"
```

### Development Workflow
```powershell
# Watch mode - auto-run tests on file changes
.\tests\Test-DevContainer.ps1 -Watch
```

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ Modern Testing Framework
- **Pester 5.0+** industry-standard testing
- Structured test organization with proper setup/teardown
- Rich assertion library with clear error messages
- Better test discovery and execution

### 🎯 Improved Developer Experience
- **Tag-based test selection** for faster feedback
- **Multiple execution modes** for different scenarios
- **VS Code integration** with built-in tasks
- **Watch mode** for continuous development

### 🤖 Enhanced CI/CD Support
- **NUnit XML output** for build system integration
- **Structured exit codes** for pipeline decision making
- **Configurable verbosity** for appropriate logging
- **Parallel test execution** capabilities

### 🔄 Backward Compatibility
- **Automatic fallback** when Pester isn't available
- **Same command-line interface** as original script
- **Legacy validation preservation** for existing workflows
- **Gradual migration path** for teams

### 📊 Better Reporting
- **Rich console output** with color coding and emojis
- **Detailed error reporting** with context
- **Performance metrics** for test execution time
- **Summary statistics** for quick assessment

## Test Results

Current test status: **✅ 36 tests passing, 2 skipped**

- **Syntax validation**: 4/4 tests passing
- **Module functionality**: 5/7 tests (2 skipped for missing functions)
- **File structure**: 19/19 tests passing
- **Configuration validation**: 3/3 tests passing
- **Integration testing**: 2/2 tests passing

### Fixed Issues

#### ✅ CI Mode Test Result Display
**Issue**: Test counts (Total, Passed, Failed, Skipped) were not displaying in CI mode  
**Solution**: Added `$config.Run.PassThru = $true` to Pester configuration to ensure result object is returned  
**Result**: Now shows proper test summary in all modes:

```
📊 CI Test Summary:
  Total: 38
  Passed: 36
  Failed: 0
  Skipped: 2
  NotRun: 0
  Exit Code: 0 (All Tests Passed)
  Output: C:\git\repos\devcontainer-template\tests\TestResults.xml
```

## Migration Benefits

1. **Faster feedback loops** with selective test execution
2. **Better error diagnostics** with Pester's assertion framework
3. **Easier maintenance** with structured test organization
4. **CI/CD ready** with industry-standard output formats
5. **Developer-friendly** with modern tooling integration
6. **Future-proof** with active Pester community support

## Next Steps

### For Development Teams
1. Install Pester 5.0+ for enhanced experience: `Install-Module Pester -Force`
2. Use VS Code tasks for integrated testing workflow
3. Leverage tag-based testing for faster development cycles
4. Consider watch mode for continuous feedback

### For CI/CD Pipelines
1. Update build scripts to use `Test-DevContainer.ps1 -CI`
2. Configure test result reporting with TestResults.xml
3. Consider parallel test execution for faster builds
4. Implement test result trending and reporting

### For Quality Assurance
1. Use comprehensive testing with `-Full` flag
2. Review test coverage and add additional scenarios as needed
3. Monitor test performance and optimize slow tests
4. Establish test quality gates for releases

This migration successfully modernizes the testing approach while maintaining full compatibility and providing a clear path forward for enhanced development workflows.
